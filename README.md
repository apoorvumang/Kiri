Idea 1:
Do a siri kind of thing with Kookoo. User asks a question, we give him the answer.
Implementation:
1. Record what user says, convert it to flac with online convertor, send file to google speech to text
2. Result is passed to wolfram alpha
3. Answer is relayed to user through kookoo's text to speech.
Google speech to text is the main thing in this. Maybe we don't need to limit ourselves to wolfram alpha?
A whole lot of things are possible after speech to text.
